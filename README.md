# E-Commerce-Website
Its a simple E-Commerce Website using Angular, I have used Material component not Bootstrap.
To make it live
1))You should want 19.x or higher version of node for this project.
2)If you want to maintain a different version of node install "nvm" -node version manager in your local.
3)Get into the folder E-Commerce-Website and do "npm install".
4)To install Angular CLI globally use "npm install -g @angular/cli"
5)To add material component in the project use "ng add @angular/material".
6)use "npm install jspdf", "npm install jspdf-autotable" and "npm install html2pdf.js --save" to install and use the Pdf file generator and downloader.
